# Trip-Reimbursement
Program to managing and controlling reimbursement in organization.

## How it looks like
### Brief
The application is designed for organizations that want to divide reimbursements
based on employees' roles. An office worker might require different needs, such as parking fees, compared to a salesman who might claim expenses for car trips and fuel. Similarly, management staff might seek reimbursements for hotel stays and business-related meetings.
The application provides an overview of the current reimbursement situation. 
### Purpose and scope of the project
The application has two main view: One for Administrator and another for the User. 
The administrator can:
 - create user groups, such as CEO, regular worker, office worker
 - set limits for particular user groups
 - manage receipt types assigned to specific user groups
 - review the total monthly reimbursement value
Users can:
 - create new reimbursements
 - review history of their reimbursement
